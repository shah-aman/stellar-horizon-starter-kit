# CRITICAL: Generate a strong password and keep it secure
# Use: openssl rand -base64 32

# === NETWORK CONFIGURATION ===
# Stellar network to connect to: pubnet, testnet, or futurenet
# For production server, typically pubnet
STELLAR_NETWORK=pubnet

# === FULL HISTORY RETENTION CONFIGURATION ===
# Enable ingestion (set to false for read-only API nodes)
INGEST=true

# Number of ledgers to retain - SET TO 0 FOR FULL HISTORY
# 0 = Unlimited retention (keeps all ledgers from genesis)
# WARNING: This requires significantly more storage space

# === PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION FOR FULL HISTORY SYNC ===
# Parallel job size - reduced for full history to manage memory usage
PARALLEL_JOB_SIZE=50000

# Enable parallel history downloads for faster initial sync

# === DATABASE OPTIMIZATION FOR FULL HISTORY ===
# Maximum database connections (increased for full history workload)

# === PRODUCTION API SETTINGS ===
# Rate limiting (requests per hour) - adjust based on expected API usage
PER_HOUR_RATE_LIMIT=7200

# Network timeouts (in seconds) - increased for full history processing
HTTP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT=60
CAPTIVE_CORE_HTTP_TIMEOUT=60

# === DISK USAGE ESTIMATES FOR FULL HISTORY ===
# WARNING: Full history requires SIGNIFICANTLY more storage:
#
# PostgreSQL Database (17.6TB disk - /data/postgres):
# - Processed data: ~8-15TB (full history as of 2024)
# - Indexes: ~2-4TB
# - WAL files: ~50-100GB
# - Backups: ~2-4TB
# - Total: ~12-19TB (may exceed 17.6TB disk - MONITOR CLOSELY)
#
# Captive Core Storage (32TB disk - /data/horizon):
# - History archives: ~2-5TB (during sync)
# - Ledger buckets: ~3-6TB (steady state)
# - Temporary files: ~1-2TB
# - Total: ~6-13TB (should fit on 32TB disk)
#
# TOTAL STORAGE NEEDED: ~18-32TB
# WARNING: You may need additional storage for PostgreSQL!

# === INITIAL SYNC TIME ESTIMATES FOR FULL HISTORY ===
# Expected sync times for full history (as of 2024):
# - Testnet: 2-7 days (depends on hardware and network)
# - Pubnet: 7-21 days (largest dataset, most time-consuming)
# - Futurenet: 1-3 days (newer network)
#
# Note: Full history sync downloads ALL ledgers since genesis.
# This is a one-time process but takes significantly longer.

# === RESOURCE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR FULL HISTORY ===
# For optimal full history performance:
# - RAM: 32GB minimum, 64GB+ recommended
# - CPU: 16+ cores recommended for faster processing
# - Network: Very stable high-bandwidth connection
# - Disk: Monitor space usage - you may need more PostgreSQL storage

# === MONITORING CONFIGURATION ===
# Enable detailed monitoring for production
ENABLE_ASSET_STATS=true
ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL_INGESTION=false

# === BACKUP SETTINGS ===
# Automated backup retention (days) - reduced for full history
BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS=3

# === SECURITY SETTINGS ===
# Disable admin endpoints on public interface (security)
DISABLE_ADMIN_ON_PUBLIC_HTTP=true

# === OPTIONAL: ADVANCED TUNING FOR FULL HISTORY ===
# Uncomment and adjust these for fine-tuning if needed

# Transaction submission settings
# DISABLE_TX_SUB=false

# Asset statistics (can be resource intensive with full history)
# ENABLE_ASSET_STATS=true

# Connection pool settings for high-load scenarios
